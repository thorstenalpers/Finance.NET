# Contributing to Finance.NET

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We aim to make the process as smooth and transparent as possible, whether you're:

- Reporting a bug  
- Starting a discussion  
- Submitting a fix  
- Suggesting a new feature  

## How to Contribute

We generally use pull requests for contributions. Here's a quick guide to the usual process:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch from `main`.
2. Add tests if your code introduces new logic that needs testing.
3. Update any relevant documentation, especially if you change public APIs.
4. Make sure all tests pass.
5. Ensure your code follows formatting and linting guidelines.
6. Open a pull request!

## It's good to check in first

You're welcome to submit a pull request at any time. However, it's often helpful to open a new issue or comment on an existing one before getting started — especially for larger changes — so we can align early and avoid duplicate efforts.

## Licensing

By submitting contributions, you agree that they will be licensed under the same [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that governs this project.

## Bug Reports

We track bugs using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/thorstenalpers/Finance.NET/issues). If you've found a problem, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/thorstenalpers/Finance.NET/issues/new/choose) — it's quick and easy.
